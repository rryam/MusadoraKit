On \"Love Kills\" and \"Hang With Me,\" Robyn reminds listeners to steel themselves against the potential hurt and heartbreak of love. Alongside those considerable moments of vulnerability, there are also songs that teem with strutting, defiant confidence: the stark \"Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do\" and the bizarre but wonderful Snoop Dogg collaboration \"U Should Know Better,\" with its pulsing beats and playful boasting. (Few pop stars save for Robyn could successfully deliver a line like \"Even the Vatican knows not to fuck with me.\") And every single track here is an airtight addition to the vision articulated on \"Fembot\": This is an album that's immaculate and poised, featuring a protagonist unafraid to bare her soul.",
